# Mobile-Robotics-Development-Platform
The low cost robot that mimics the capabilities of the TurtleBot.

The mrdp package contains ROS and OpenCV programs for navigation and localization. Please explore Gmapping, and amcl ROS packages. 

Odometry folder contains programs that can be run on arduinos connected to a rotary encoder. These programs can be used as examples. ROSserial is needed to interface the laptop with the arduino board.

I have included an exhaustive list of all the packages one might need for SLAM using the TurtleBot or any robot for that matter.
